## How to use?

In terminal type the following:  
python(3) main.py [csv_path]

python main.py OriginalData.csv

## Solved Tasks:  

1. Vizualization:  We have three diagrams showing the following:  
- Radar view
- Speed time
- Vehicle path

2. Event classification:
- We can tell when, what kind of accident occured
This isn't fully visualized -> we don't plot the kind of accident that has occured, but we create a result.csv with a column that contains tha accident Id_type like 1_CPTA
